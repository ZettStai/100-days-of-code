Gonna try to do the #100DaysOfCode again. I don't think I ever got to day 100 before... My main focus is gonna be re-writing a discord.js fan bot to use http://discord.py instead and make it more generic for all fandoms. Today I started writing the hello world of it

### [R2D2](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1281447709212160000?s=20)
Started writing the logic to use different commands in python. We're looking to break out each command into sub commands to switch based on a particular fandom.  http://Discord.py looks like it can organize commands better with Cogs.

### [R2D3](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1281808612201869312?s=20)
Decided to start writing the leaderboard code. One of the main reasons I switched to Python. Not sure why the NodeJS code for MongoDB was so complicated. I think I might be able to finish retrieving profiles this weekend.

### [R2D4](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1282183500888592384?s=20)
Started parsing MongoDB results from BSON.

### [R2D5](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1282547099091890177?s=20)
Wrote the code to query MongoDB for a specific id. My main focus tomorrow will be writing the discord code to get the id from the message author and return the stats object for that user.

Finally got funds from unemployment so been trying to get my finances in order. Haven’t got to code much but I did start writing down the issues for the new bot. It’s given me better perspective on what types of functions to write

### [R2D7](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1284350988862668800?s=20)
I'm painfully aware that these days are not consecutive, but I've been doing HR screening calls all week. Been trying to code when I can. Took a break from the bot to work on HackerRank practice for upcoming technical interviews

### [R2D8](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1284714306139942913?s=20)
Did a mock interview with the help of @__darlenewong__ today. Definitely need to brush up on some basics but felt good that my logic was sound. Going to focus tomorrow on working on what I learned

### [R2D9](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1286555077927305216?s=20)
Took what I learned from the mock interview and finally wrote the logic to create questions for the trivia part of the discord bot I'm working on. I have two technical interviews tomorrow. Wish me luck Victory hand

### [R2D10](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1288008452191563778?s=20)
Had another technical interview today and got the rejection email a few hours later. Trying to stay positive and finish what I remember. It uses an opensource weather API and I wrote code to parse input and creates the uris for the calls

### [R2D11](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1288008452191563778?s=20)
I thought about restarting this round again completely, but I anticipate this won't be the last time I break the streak. It is more important that I keep going. Today I got familiar with git again and am getting ready for #hacktoberfest2020

### [R2D12](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1312287751560019968?s=20)
I decided to spend time working on my personal website. First a basic portfolio like website and adding a blog portion. Started looking into this template and getting familiar with the basics https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio

### [R2D13](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1312657030419685376?s=20)
Working on Discord bot. Did some research and started playing around with parsing RSS feeds. I want to be able to have the bot check for new episodes of podcasts and post them in a channel.

### [R2D14](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1312999478534664192?s=20)
Continued working on Discord bot. Played around with AO3 module. Working on storing data of fics in MongoDB for future reference

### [R2D15](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1314464870289477632?s=20)
Took another mini break due to interviews this week. Had an onsite virtual interview with Apple today. Intense as 3 of them involved coding. Fingers crossed I did well. I was told a few times that coding wouldn’t be a huge deal. Hoping I did ok

### [R2D16](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1316617198488625152?s=20)
Worked on discord bot. Started integrating trivia module with discord commands.

### [R2D17](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1318777729492287489?s=20)
Interview today. Fastest I've probably completed the palindrome problem thanks to strings being lists and reversing strings. Worked on the trivia for the bot as well.

### [R2D18](https://twitter.com/ZettStai/status/1321851656271622144?s=20) - October 22, 2020
Got my Problem Solving (Basic) Certificate from HackerRank
